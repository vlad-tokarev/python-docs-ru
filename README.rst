Russian Translation of the Python Documentation
==============================================

(Makefile and workflow were copied from official French docs project)

**Translated: 0.5%**

Documentation Contribution Agreement
------------------------------------

NOTE REGARDING THE LICENSE FOR TRANSLATIONS: Python's documentation is
maintained using a global network of volunteers. By posting this
project on Transifex, Github, and other public places, and inviting
you to participate, we are proposing an agreement that you will
provide your improvements to Python's documentation or the translation
of Python's documentation for the PSF's use under the CC0 license
(available at
https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode). In
return, you may publicly claim credit for the portion of the
translation you contributed and if your translation is accepted by the
PSF, you may (but are not required to) submit a patch including an
appropriate annotation in the Misc/ACKS or TRANSLATORS file. Although
nothing in this Documentation Contribution Agreement obligates the PSF
to incorporate your textual contribution, your participation in the
Python community is welcomed and appreciated.

You signify acceptance of this agreement by submitting your work to
the PSF for inclusion in the documentation.


Contributing to the Translation
-------------------------------

How to Contribute
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can contribute using:

- github (preferred solution)
- `transifex <https://www.transifex.com/python-doc/public/>`_
- Or just by opening `an issue on github <https://github.com/python/python-docs-ru/issues>`_


Contributing using Github
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prerequisites:

- A `github account <https://github.com/join>`_.
- ``git`` `installed <https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/>`_ (for windows, see
  https://gitforwindows.org/).
- A ``.po`` file editor (Use `poedit <https://poedit.net/>`_
  if you don't already have one).


Let's start:

You'll need to fork the `python-docs-ru
<https://github.com/python/python-docs-ru>`_ clicking its ``Fork``
button. This creates a copy of the whole project on your github
account: a place where you have the rights to do modifications.

Step by step:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Git clone your github fork using ssh (replace vlad-tokarev):
    git clone git@github.com:vlad-tokarev/python-docs-ru.git

    # Go to the cloned directory:
    cd python-docs-ru/

    # Add the upstream (the public repository) using HTTPS (won't ask for password):
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/python/python-docs-ru.git


Now you're ready to start a work session, each time you'll start a new task, start here:

.. code-block:: bash

    # To work, we'll need a branch, based on an up-to-date (freshly fetched)
    # upstream/3.7 branch, let's say we'll work on glossary so we name
    # the branch "glossary":
    git fetch upstream
    git checkout -b glossary upstream/3.7

    # You can now work on the file, typically using poedit,
    poedit directory/file.po

    # After writing your changes to disk, check for correctness:
    make

    # Sphinx will tell you if there is any syntax error in the files
    # you modified. Note that in the Russian Translation, we try to keep Sphinx
    # warnings to zero.

    # you may want to check if there are semantic errors.
    # Open the translated file in your browser to check how it renders.
    # Don't forget to verify the typography. The Russian conventions are not
    # the English ones, especially for punctuation.
    exo-open ../cpython/Doc/build/html/directory/file.html

    # When everything is clear (syntax errors from Sphinx, html rendering,
    # semantics, typography),
    # you can commit your work with a nice explicit message:
    git commit -a -m "Working on glossary."

    # Then push your modifications to your github clone,
    # as they are ephemeral branches, let's not configure git to track them all,
    # "origin HEAD" is a "special" syntax to say "Push on origin,
    # on a branch with the same name as the local one",
    # it's nice as it's exactly what we want:
    git push origin HEAD

    # Now you can open the pull request on github, just go to
    # https://github.com/python/python-docs-ru/ and a nice "Compare & pull request"
    # button should appear after a few seconds telling you can ask for a pull request.

    # Now someone is reviewing your modifications, and you'll want to fix their
    # findings, get back to your branch
    # (in case you started something else on another branch):
    git checkout glossary
    # Fix the issues, then commit again:
    git commit -a -m "glossary: small fixes."
    git push origin HEAD


You may have noted that this looks like a triangle, with a missing segment:

- You're fetching from upstream (public common repo on github)
- You're pushing to origin (your clone on github)

So yes it's the work of someone to add the last segment, from your
origin to the public upstream, to "close the loop", that's the role of
the people who merges pull requests after proofreading them.

You may also have noted you never ever commit on a version branch
(``3.6``, ``3.7``, ...), only pull from them, consider them read-only
you'll avoid problems.


What to translate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can start with easy tasks like reviewing fuzzy entries to help
keeping the documentation up to date (find them using ``make fuzzy``).

You can also proofread already translated entries, and finally
translate untranslated ones (find them using ``make todo``)..

- Do not translate content of ``:ref:...`` and ``:term:...``
- Put english words, if you have to use them, in *italics* (surrounded
  by stars).
- ``::`` at the end of some paragraphs have to be translated to `` :
  ::`` in Russian to place the space before the column.
- If you translate a link title, please translate the link too
  (typically if it's Wikipedia and the article has a translation). If
  no translation of the target exists, do not translate the
  title.


Where to get help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The coordinator for this translation is `vlad tokarev <https://telegram.me/v_tokarev>`_.

Feel free to ask your questions on the `telegram group
<https://t.me/python_docs_ru>`_


Glossary
--------

For consistency in our translations, here are some propositions and
reminders for frequent terms you'll have to translate, don't hesitate
to open an issue if you disagree.

Simplify git diffs
------------------

Git diffs are often crowded with useless line number changes, like:

.. code-block:: diff

    -#: ../Doc/library/signal.rst:406
    +#: ../Doc/library/signal.rst:408

To tell git they are not usefull information, you can do the following
after ensuring ``~/.local/bin/`` is in your ``PATH``.

.. code-block:: bash

    cat <<EOF > ~/.local/bin/podiff
    #!/bin/sh
    grep -v '^#:' "\$1"
    EOF

    chmod a+x ~/.local/bin/podiff

    git config diff.podiff.textconv podiff


Maintenance
-----------

All those snippets are to run from the root of a ``python-docs-ru``
clone, and some expect to find an up-to-date CPython clone near to it,
like::

.. code-block:: bash

  ~/
  ├── python-docs-ru/
  └── cpython/

To clone CPython you may use:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone --depth 1 --no-single-branch https://github.com/python/cpython.git

This avoids to download the whole history (not usefull to build
documentation) but still fetches all branches.


Merge pot files from CPython
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

  make merge


Find fuzzy strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

  make fuzzy


Run a test build locally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

  make


Synchronize translation with Transifex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll need the ``transifex-client`` and ``poindent``
from Pypi.

You'll need to configure ``tx`` via ``tx init`` if not already done.

You should work on a separate ``transifex`` branch.

.. code-block:: bash

   tx pull
   poindent --modified
   git commit -m "tx pull"
   git checkout 3.7
   git merge transifex -Xours
   tx push -t
